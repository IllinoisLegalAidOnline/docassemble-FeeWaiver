  Instructions
subquestion: |
  To use this program you will need to know: 

  * The public benefits that you get,
  * Your income in the past month,
  * Your income over the past 12 months,
  * Your monthly expenses, and
  * The value of your belongings.

  If you are filling out this form on behalf of a minor or incompetent adult, you will need that person's information.

  You will also need to know information about the court case for which you are requesting a fee waiver. You can find this information on other court papers you have about this case. 

  Set aside 10 to 15 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later. 
 
  ${ collapse_template(help_example) }  

  Click on **{green words}** to learn what they mean. Some pages have a question mark in a circle ${ fa_icon("question-circle", color_css="#0dcaf0" ) } that helps explain things.

question: |
  After you finish this program
subquestion: |
  After you download your ${ form_name }, you must file it with the court. This program does not file your ${ form_name } for you.
  
  **Note:** You can file your ${ form_name } at any time during your court case. It is usually done when a person files their first forms in a case. That way they might have all of the court fees in a case waived.
  
  To learn more, read the "How to Request a Fee Waiver (Civil)" instructions you can download at the end of this program.

id: civil circuit court only
continue button field: civil_fee_waiver
question: |
  Civil fee waiver for Circuit Court 
subquestion: |
  You can use this program to make Fee waiver forms if you have a **civil case** in Circuit Court. For example, divorce cases, family cases, eviction cases, small claims cases, foreclosure cases, and lawsuits for injury or property damage. You can also use this fee waiver if you are asking the judge to expunge or seal a criminal case.
  
  There are different fee waiver forms to use if:

  * Your case is a criminal, traffic, or juvenile justice case. If you need to ask for a fee waiver in a criminal case, use the [**Criminal Court fee waiver Easy Form**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/154466).
  * Your case is in the Appellate Court. If you need to ask for a fee waiver in an Appellate case, use the [**Fee waiver - Appellate Court Easy Form**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/88446). 
  * Your case is in the Illinois Supreme Court. If you need to ask for a fee waiver in a Supreme Court case, use the [**Fee waiver - Supreme Court of Illinois Easy Form**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/node/158696).

  The judge will consider ${ your_or_their } income, assets, and expenses. Our prediction
  is based only on ${ your_or_their } income.
  
  For ${ your_or_their} household size, ${ your_or_their } monthly income needs to be at or below 
  ${ currency(poverty_scale_get_income_limit(household_size=household_size, multiplier=1.25)/12) }.
  
  You said that ${ your_or_their } income over the last month was 
  ${ currency(user_income_total) }.
  
  You said that ${ your_or_their} income over the last 12 months was 
  ${ currency(user_annual_total) } (${ currency(user_annual_total/12) }
  per month).
  
  The judge will also consider ${ your_or_their } total assets of ${ currency(user_asset_total) }
  and ${ your_or_their } total monthly expenses of ${ currency(user_expense_total) }.

  **What else the judge will consider**
content: |  
  The judge will look at all of the information that you provided on this
  form to decide if ${ you_or_they } qualify. For example, the judge will compare ${ your_or_their }
  assets and expenses. They will also read any additional explanation that you
  decide to provide.
  
  Some of ${ your_or_their } assets will not be counted. For example: the value of ${ your_or_their } car,
  up to $2,400, is not counted. A person can have up to $4,000 in other assets,
  such as bank accounts, that are not counted. The assets that are not
  counted are set by law: specifically, 
  [**735 ILCS 5/12-901**](https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=073500050K12-1001)

  The judge may decide that ${ you_or_they } qualify for a partial reduction in court fees even if ${ you_or_they } do not qualify for a full waiver.

  Supporting documents
subquestion: |
  After you file your Fee waiver application, a judge will review it. If they have questions, you may need to give more information or documentation. For example, you may be asked to show:
  
  * Proof of public benefits received,
  * Proof of income, and
  * The value of any belongings.
  
  **Note:** Some courts require that you submit proof of benefits or income when you file your Fee waiver application. If you are e-filing, you may need to upload proof of benefits or income.
  
  Ask your Circuit Clerk what they require. You can look up how to contact them on the [**Illinois Courts website**](https://www.illinoiscourts.gov/courts-directory/interactive-map/by-court-type).
  
  If you have a court date for your Fee waiver application, be sure to bring whatever documentation is requested.
